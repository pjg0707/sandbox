# Welcome to the Sandbox repo!
A safe place to try random and small stuff that is not worth a dedicated repo (yet).

## Getting Started
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pjg0707/sandbox.git
```
Feel free to add, modify, or experiment with any files as needed. No special setup is required.
